## Load data

```{r}

superheroes <- readRDS(here("data","superheroes.rds"))
publishers <- readRDS(here("data","publishers.rds"))

```

```{r}

superheroes

publishers

```

## "Inner" Join

The most common type we'll use early on. Looks for only when things match up in both tables.

![](images/innerjoin.png)

Let's do it... we'll use dplyr's `inner_join()` function.

```{r}

inner_join(superheroes, publishers)


```

Wait, how did it even know what to join?

By default it looks for column names in columns. This can be good, but also can give you problems if you're not careful.

How do we tell R to specifically match on a column?

```{r}

inner_join(superheroes, publishers, by = "publisher")


```

## Left Join

This is for when you want *everything* from the first table no matter what, but joining up those that match from the second.

![](images/leftjoin.png)

Let's give it a try...

```{r}

left_join(superheroes, publishers, by = "publisher")


```

## Full Join

This is for when you want *everything* from *both* tables no matter what....matching where they match, and leaving blank where they don't.

![](images/fulljoin.png)

Let's give it a go...

```{r}

full_join(superheroes, publishers, by = "publisher")


```

## Anti-Join

Finally, there's the "anti" join, which sounds like what it is -- looking for records in one table that are *not* in the other based on the matching variable.

![](images/antijoin.png)

Let's try it...

```{r}

anti_join(superheroes, publishers, by = "publisher")


```

We'll do more with joins in the weeks to come.
